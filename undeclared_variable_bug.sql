The following SQL query attempts to use a variable in the SELECT statement that hasn't been properly declared or initialized within the scope of the query:

```sql
SELECT col1, col2, @myVar AS calculatedCol FROM myTable;
```

The variable `@myVar` needs to be declared using `SET` or `DECLARE` and assigned a value before being used in the `SELECT` statement.  Failure to do so will either result in an error (depending on the database system) or unexpected results (potentially returning NULL).
